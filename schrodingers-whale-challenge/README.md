# Schrödinger's Whale - CTF Challenge

## Setup
docker-compose up -d

## Objective
The whale exists in quantum superposition. Your goal is to:
1. Observe the system using external methods only
2. Collect quantum fragments from different observation techniques
3. Reconstruct the complete quantum state
4. Collapse the wave function to reveal both possible states

## Rules
- Do NOT enter the container (`docker exec` defeats the purpose)
- All observations must be external
- Multiple observation methods reveal different information
- Combine all fragments to reconstruct reality

## Hints
- Think like a quantum physicist - how do you observe without interfering?
- Docker has many ways to inspect containers externally
- Some information exists in places you might not expect
- The past (layers) remembers what the present has forgotten

Good luck, observer.
