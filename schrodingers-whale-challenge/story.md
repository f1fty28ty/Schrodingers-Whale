# The Quantum Cetacean Paradox

Dr. Erwin Schröwhale, a brilliant marine quantum physicist, has created 
an experimental Docker container that exists in a state of quantum 
superposition. Unlike Schrödinger's famous cat, this whale exists 
simultaneously in multiple states until observed.

The problem? Dr. Schröwhale's lab was raided by Docker security for 
unauthorized quantum experiments. The complete system configuration was 
fragmented and hidden across multiple quantum observation planes to 
prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.

Your mission: Act as an external observer and reconstruct the complete 
quantum state of the whale through careful, non-invasive observation 
techniques. Each observation method collapses a different part of the 
wave function, revealing fragments of the truth.

Remember: In quantum mechanics, the act of observation changes reality. 
Choose your observation methods wisely.

The whale is both alive and dead. The flag is both there and not there.
Until you observe correctly.
